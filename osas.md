## 3 - Once Saved, Always Saved (OSAS)

The biggest **enemy** to the gospel is the doctrine of **work based salvation** _(You don’t have to do anything to be saved, BUT if you don't do work, you can lose it)_. Teaching the OSAS doctrine removes the doubt in their mind, allowing them to fully trust Christ as their Saviour. 

If you can lose your salvation, you are basically saying that you have to do something to be saved, or maintain some level of morality. This is one of the best ways to tell if someone is saved or not. Don't explain this doctrine AFTER prayer, as this is where it usually clicks for the person.

```Galatians 2:16 - Knowing that a man is not justified by the works of the law, but by the faith of Jesus Christ, even we have believed in Jesus Christ, that we might be justified by the faith of Christ, and not by the works of the law: for by the works of the law shall no flesh be justified.```

```Romans 3:20 - Therefore by the deeds of the law there shall no flesh be justified in his sight: for by the law is the knowledge of sin.```

We are justified by faith. 
```1 John 5:10 - He that believeth on the Son of God hath the witness in himself: he that believeth not God hath made him a liar; because he believeth not the record that God gave of his Son.```

```Titus 1:2 - In hope of eternal life, which God, that cannot lie, promised before the world began;```

#### Two kinds of people: 

* Those that believe God and in the record that He has given us eternal life through His son. 
* Those who made God a liar. 

#### How long is eternal? 
Forever..everlasting..

```John 3:36 He that believeth on the Son hath everlasting life: and he that believeth not the Son shall not see life; but the wrath of God abideth on him.```

That doesn't mean we should keep sinning, but if we do, we are covered.

```Romans 6:1-2 - What shall we say then? Shall we continue in sin, that grace may abound? God forbid. How shall we, that are dead to sin, live any longer therein?```

```1 John 2:1-2 - My little children, these things write I unto you, that ye sin not. And if any man sin, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous: And he is the propitiation for our sins: and not for ours only, but also for the sins of the whole world.```

An easy way to explain is to use the analogy of a gift.

```Romans 6:23 - For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.```

A gift is not something you pay for, but something that is given to you. If someone gives you a gift, it is yours now. They don't have the right to come back later and take it back, then it wasn't a gift. If the gift is eternal life, you only need to receive it once. Paid for by the giver (Christ) we receive it for free, and it is eternal (forever). 

Another illustration is of a **Father and a Son.**

```John 1:12 - But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on his name:```

= If we believe on the name of Jesus, we become the sons of God. 

Ask them if they have children, or use their child as an example. 
If your child breaks the rules, you are going to discipline them, but you're not going to throw them out of the family. They are always going to be a part of the family. Even if they said “well i'm not sure you're really my dad/mom”, that doubt wouldn't make them no longer your child. 

He will discipline you and chastise you. But what He won't do is leave you or forsake you. 
The way you balance the doctrine of eternal security is with the chastisement of God. If you sin, God is going to punish you, even if you're saved.
The lifestyle that we live matters. It doesn't matter in regards to our salvation, but you will still be punished on this earth. There are still consequences for our actions. 

```Hebrews 12:9–11 - Furthermore we have had fathers of our flesh which corrected us, and we gave them reverence: shall we not much rather be in subjection unto the Father of spirits, and live? For they verily for a few days chastened us after their own pleasure; but he for our profit, that we might be partakers of his holiness. Now no chastening for the present seemeth to be joyous, but grievous: nevertheless afterward it yieldeth the peaceable fruit of righteousness unto them which are exercised thereby.```

```Matthew 5:19 - Whosoever therefore shall break one of these least commandments, and shall teach men so, he shall be called the least in the kingdom of heaven: but whosoever shall do and teach them, the same shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven.```

```Hebrews 13:5 - Let your conversation be without covetousness; and be content with such things as ye have: for he hath said, I will never leave thee, nor forsake thee.```

```Romans 8:38-39 - For I am persuaded, that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come, Nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.```

Then, you can go into an even **easier explanation.**

Well, what if you do something really bad though? A really big sin? 

If I go out and commit a really big sin, I'm going to get a really big punishment, on this earth. 

E.g if i kill someone, I could go to jail. If I commit adultery, I could lose my job or my family. 

But that's on earth, when we get to the Great white throne of judgement, when it comes to Heaven and Hell, it depends on whether we have believed on Jesus Christ as our Saviour. 

```John 10:28 - And I give unto them eternal life; and they shall never perish, neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand.```

```John 5:24 - Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that heareth my word, and believeth on him that sent me, hath everlasting life, and shall not come into condemnation; but is passed from death unto life.```

Have - present tense. Not in the future, not temporary. 

Don't go crazy with the examples e.g mass murderers, serial killers, or you will start to sound ridiculous.
