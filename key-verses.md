```For whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth, and scourgeth every son whom he receiveth. If ye endure chastening, God dealeth with you as with sons; for what son is he whom the father chasteneth not? But if ye be without chastisement, whereof all are partakers, then are ye bastards, and not sons. Furthermore we have had fathers of our flesh which corrected us, and we gave them reverence: shall we not much rather be in subjection unto the Father of spirits, and live? For they verily for a few days chastened us after their own pleasure; but he for our profit, that we might be partakers of his holiness. Now no chastening for the present seemeth to be joyous, but grievous: nevertheless afterward it yieldeth the peaceable fruit of righteousness unto them which are exercised thereby.```

Have - present tense. Not in the future, not temporary. 

#### Sample prayer
```“Dear Lord. I know I'm a sinner, I know I deserve to go to hell, but I believe that you died on the cross for my sins and rose again. Please save me right now and give me eternal life. I'm only trusting you Jesus, Amen.”```

#### Confess
Romans 10:13

```For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.```

Romans 10:9-10

```That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved. For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation.```


Confessing isn't a “work”

#### Jewish

Signs
