## 1 - Starting the Conversation

Depending on if you're going soul winning with a church versus doing it with friends or by yourself, generally you'll want to follow this pattern:

* **With a church:** "Hey, my name is (Your Name) and I'm with (Your Church's Name) inviting you to come visit. Do you go to church anywhere around here? Well hey more important than church:"

* **Independent:** "Hey, my name is (Your Name) and I'm a Baptist going around spreading the gospel and asking people this important question:"

Next, follow up with the question "God forbid, if you were to die today, are you 100% sure you'd go to heaven?"

* **Not 100% sure:** "Alright, well if you have 10 minutes I'd love to show you how the Bible says you can be 100% sure."

* **Claims to be 100% sure:** "Awesome! If I may, what do you believe it takes to go to heaven?"

* **Anything but 100% faith alone:** "A lot of people think that (you have to be a good person, turn from sins, go to church, etc...) but the Bible says something different. Mind if I share that with you?"

* **Answers 100% faith alone:** "Amen, that's what I/we believe as well."

If they give any answer that doesn't end in 100% assurance in faith alone, give the gospel.

* If they don't want to hear the gospel (busy, gives an excuse, just not interested), leave them with a verse such as from John 3:16. "Hey let me just leave you with one quick verse." If they seem receptive after that, offer again to share the gospel, and if they are still refusing to hear it, tell them to have a great day and move on to the next door.
* Cut to the chase don't waste people's time: let them know who you are and why you are there
* Ask questions but don't interrogate people

### Figure out their beliefs first:
* Are you a Christian? A Lot of people will give you a positive answer
* Do you go to church anywhere?

**If they say yes to the above**, ask them if they were to die today, would they go to Heaven? If they __don't__ say “yes for sure” and have doubt, then present the gospel. _“Well, the Bible says we can know for sure, can i show you where?”_

**If they say no to the above answers**, start off by asking if they mind if they show you from the Bible how you can go to Heaven.

**If they're not interested**, still leave on a positive note. Leave them with a card/tract. Tell them about a youtube video to watch/link. 

Say _“No worries, can I just leave you with one quick verse?”_ 9/10 people will accept that verse.

Could be John 3:16, and then expound on it e.g _“Notice how the verse doesnt say “whosoever do good works, or go to church, or live a good life. Alright God bless you have a great day.”_ Every once in a while they may give a positive reaction and want to hear more. _“Well hey, let me show you a little more?”_

**If they say the right answer:** _“Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ!”_

Follow up with _“Well, Do you think there is anything you can do to lose that salvation?” _

### Personal life - Friends, Family, Coworkers
Great opportunities for discipleship as you see them frequently. 

If you are alone with someone, give them the gospel. 

How do you start the conversation? Bring up the topic of Church. 

_“Do you go to church anywhere?” “Are you a Christian?”_

And then go on from the same way you do at the door.  

_“Well more important than that.. Do you know if you died today would you go to Heaven?”_

_**Important: You must truly love people - being nice/friendly comes naturally and comes from the heart. People will sense that.**_
