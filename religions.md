## 5 - Tips for Different Religions
_“We're not argument winning, we're soul winning”_

The same gospel works for everybody - most false religions are based on works based salvation anyway. It's okay to not know everything - you can just say “I don't know” to questions you can't answer. As long as you aren't spreading lies, it's okay. 

Sometimes you can know too much about a religion and get caught up in lengthy debates that will lead nowhere. To prevent this, you could say “Let's get back to that” and get back to the point. Deal with specific heresies at the end. Get the gospel out there first, that's where the power is.

  _Romans 1:16
For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ: for it is the power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth; to the Jew first, and also to the Greek._

There are specific tips that can help with soul winning that do work. Ask them if they go to church anywhere.
If at any time they take over the conversation (80-90% of the talking), walk away. Don't let a false prophet teach you lies. You came to win people to Christ not speak to heretics. 

### Jehovah's Witnesses
* Can recognise them if they say they go to “The Kingdom Hall” as their church
* Don't ask them “If you know for sure if you died today you are going to Heaven?” This will lead to a rabbit trail of “well only the 144,000 are going to   Heaven..were going to be on this earth.. etc”
* Ask them “Do you know for sure, if you died today, that you're saved and have eternal life?” “are you 100% sure you're saved?”
* If by the end, you can convince them to believe in it’s all by faith and eternal security, then say “Can prove to you that Jesus is God with the Bible?” As you've already shown them they were wrong on the first 2 points
* JH believes that Jesus is a created being. In their fake Bible in John 1:1 they changed it to say that Jesus was “a” God. 

Good verses for **Trinity** to show them:

  _1 Timothy 3:16
   And without controversy great is the mystery of godliness: God was manifest in the flesh, justified in the Spirit, seen of angels, preached unto the Gentiles, believed on in the world, received up into glory._

  _Hebrews 1:8
But unto the Son he saith, Thy throne, O God, is for ever and ever: a sceptre of righteousness is the sceptre of thy kingdom._

  _Isaiah 9:6
For unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given: and the government shall be upon his shoulder: and his name shall be called Wonderful, Counsellor, The mighty God, The everlasting Father, The Prince of Peace._

This verse is good to explain as they are taught to use it **against** us. 

  _Matthew 19:17
And he said unto him, Why callest thou me good? there is none good but one, that is, God: but if thou wilt enter into life, keep the commandments.
Show them and ask them “Is Jesus good?”_

Typical answer: “Well of course!”, 

Response: “Well there is no one good but God..So you either have two choices. Either Jesus is God, or He is not good, you going to tell me Jesus isn't good?”

**Don't** take them to:

  _1 John 5:7
For there are three that bear record in heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghost: and these three are one._

Or John 1

As they are indoctrinated to counter argument these verses. They've heard them their whole life. 

Make sure you emphasise the bodily resurrection of Jesus because they've been taught a fake resurrection about how Jesus spirit left His body. 

  _Luke 24:39-40
  Behold my hands and my feet, that it is I myself: handle me, and see; for a spirit hath not flesh and bones, as ye see me have. And when he had thus spoken, he shewed them his hands and his feet._

### Catholics

Go through everything the same, but add 1 step to the end right before the prayer. Say something along the lines of:
_“Now you mentioned you went to \_\_\_\_\_ church, now let me tell you the Catholic Church teaches something completely different than what I showed you today. They teach you that you actually do have to go to church, you do have to do works (confess your sins to the priest, take the sacraments). They teach you that faith is not enough to save you, but I showed you from the Bible that it is enough. So which one do you believe?”_

Make sure we aren't adding it onto the Catholic religion, it's new doctrine. 
* They may say, well no I still am sticking with the Catholic church. 
* Hopefully, they respond with _“Well I'm going to believe what the Bible says_” then you can pray with them. 
* Make sure they know to pray to God alone and no longer saints or Mary. 1 Timothy 2:5 - For there is one God, and one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus;
* Explain how they can pray to God like their Father, no longer the rosary. Matthew 6:7 - But when ye pray, use not vain repetitions, as the heathen do: for they think that they shall be heard for their much speaking.

### Atheists
Appeal to their “intellect” and ask them to at least see what they are rejecting before they make the decision. 
* _“Well even as an atheist, you must agree that the Bible is one of the most influential books in the world. 2.3 billion people claim to believe in it, 3.9 billion people claim to believe in Jesus. It's the best sold book in the world. So even as an atheist, you should have a knowledge of what it says.”_
* _“You obviously like to learn things..”_

To avoid getting into a Creation or origin debate say:
* _"Lets just pretend for a moment that there is a God, and that the Bible is true. I know you don't believe that, but let's pretend it is true. And I'm going to show you what the Bible says about Heaven and Hell, and at the end, you can decide whether you believe it or not."_

And if you get 4 minutes in and they go _“wait I don't believe that..”_ you can say _“well hang on, were pretending!”_. Let the power of God work in them as you preach the gospel, it will cut to the heart. 

### Jews
Go to Romans and the New Testament. Not the Old Testament, they don't believe in that or they would have believed Moses. Isaiah 53 a lot of them believe was written by a different author from chapters 40-66, so that wont work. 
  _John 5:46-47
For had ye believed Moses, ye would have believed me; for he wrote of me. But if ye believe not his writings, how shall ye believe my words?_

How to get the Jews saved? Show them the gospel! Show them the signs.
  _Matthew 12:40-41
For as Jonas was three days and three nights in the whale's belly; so shall the Son of man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth. The men of Nineveh shall rise in judgment with this generation, and shall condemn it: because they repented at the preaching of Jonas; and, behold, a greater than Jonas is here._

Start with Romans 3:23 - _For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;_

### Muslims, Hindus and Buddists
Standard salvation - exact same way. 
Only emphasis **at the end** is that they have to reject Islam, Hinduism and/or Buddism to accept Jesus so they dont think they can be both. Similar to the Catholics, you have to make a choice. 

### Last point
* _Titus 3:10 
A man that is an heretick after the first and second admonition reject;_

If you show them 2 scriptures and they reject it, move on. Leave on a good note, smile and be nice. Don't poison the well for the next person.
