## 2 - Explaning the Gospel 
```Matthew 4:19 - And he saith unto them, Follow me, and I will make you fishers of men.```

### You've started the conversation, now your goals are:
1. Use the Bible (KJV)

```  Romans 10:17 - So then faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word of God```

2. Make the Bible easy to understand - teach people. 
* Don't jump around the below points and make sure it flows. The goal is to be easily understood. 
* Time? As much as necessary but not too much time or you may lose people's interest. Typically takes 10-15 minutes. It may take longer sometimes, but only if you are making progress e.g they are receptive. 

### First Steps:
* You are a sinner
* You deserve to go to hell

What's the purpose of being saved, if you don't know what you are being saved from?

Show them they are a sinner. 
* _Romans 3:23 - For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;_
       
Q. What is sin?
* _1 John 3:4 Whosoever committeth sin transgresseth also the law: for sin is the transgression of the law._

There is a punishment for that:
* _Romans 6:23 - For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord._

Physical death is not the end.. After that there is Heaven and Hell. Hell is known as the second death. (Can skip if they understand Heaven/Hell)
* _Revelation 20:14-15 And death and hell were cast into the lake of fire. This is the second death. And whosoever was not found written in the book of life was cast into the lake of fire._

There is a list of people that the Bible tells us are going there. 
* _Revelation 21:8 But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death._

Well we've all lied before. 

Q. What if they say, I'm not a “liar” but I've told some lies.. 
* **A.** Revelation 21:27 _And there shall in no wise enter into it any thing that defileth, neither whatsoever worketh abomination, or maketh a lie: but they which are written in the Lamb's book of life._
* **B.** OR ask this Question. How many people do you have to murder to be a murderer? 

Q. I don't believe in a literal hell..
* Mark 9 - Jesus talked about hell at the end of Mark 9

Jesus also said..
* _1 John 3:15 Whosoever hateth his brother is a murderer: and ye know that no murderer hath eternal life abiding in him._

* _Matthew 5:28 But I say unto you, That whosoever looketh on a woman to lust after her hath committed adultery with her already in his heart._

### Next step:
1. You are a sinner

2. You deserve to go to hell

3. **Jesus loves you and died for you**


Q. But God loves you, do you think he wants you to go to hell?
* **A.** Of Course not.. You wouldn't want someone you love to go to hell?
   But when you look at Rev 21:8, do you think he was just kidding when He said that?
   Well no, because that's what we deserve… but He loves us and doesn't want us to go there. 
   So here's what He did for us to save us so that we would not go there. 
   The Bible said that _“But God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.”_ (Romans 5:8). 
   So Jesus Christ died for us, meaning that He took our place. 
   He took the punishment that we deserve and died for us..

### Next steps:
You are a sinner

You deserve to go to hell

Jesus loves you and died for you

**Who Jesus is**

**Death, Burial, and Resurrection of Christ**

#### Who is Jesus?
Don't assume people know who He is or basic principles of the Bible. 

A quick review of who Jesus is.
* The son of God
* God in the flesh
* Dwelt among us
* Lived a perfect life that none of us could live
* Performed miracles
* Preached the word of God
* A Lot of people didn't like his preaching so He was arrested and hung on the cross
* When they died they took His body and buried it in the tomb
* His soul went down to hell for 3 days and 3 nights
* Rose again and showed Himself alive with the holes in His hands (good to point out as it shows it was a bodily resurrection not a spiritual one)

The fact that Jesus died for us doesn't mean we are all going to Heaven, does it?
(Refer to Revelation again)


### Next step:
You are a sinner

You deserve to go to hell

Jesus loves you and died for you

Who Jesus is

Death, Burial, and Resurrection of Christ

**What must we do to be saved?**

So the question is, what do we have to do, in order to be saved?

The answer is found in Acts 16:30-31 (show them)

```Acts 16:30-31 And brought them out, and said, Sirs, what must I do to be saved? And they said, Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved, and thy house.```

It didn't say go to church, turn from your sins, be a good person, to be saved..

Then take them to John 3:16 
    _(Most people have heard it before, but often they haven't understood it?_

```Acts 8:31 - And he said, How can I, except some man, should guide me? And he desired Philip that he would come up and sit with him.```

```John 3:16 For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.```

You could even show them more verses on salvation by faith.

```Ephesians 2:8-9 - For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: Not of works, lest any man should boast.```

```John 6:47 - Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that believeth on me hath everlasting life.```

#### Next step:
You are a sinner

You deserve to go to hell

Jesus loves you and died for you

Who Jesus is

Death, Burial, and Resurrection of Christ

What must we do to be saved?

**Eternal security of the believer**
