## 4 - Finishing Leading in Prayer

```2 Corinthians 6:2 - (For he saith, I have heard thee in a time accepted, and in the day of salvation have I succoured thee: behold, now is the accepted time; behold, now is the day of salvation.)```

Show them the difference:
When I got here, you mentioned that “\_\_\_\_” (e.g you weren't sure you were going to Heaven)
You probably thought that I've done good and I'll get to Heaven, now you see that it's all by faith.

After you have explained eternal security to someone, make sure that they understood what you said by asking a few questions.
* Do you believe that Jesus Christ died on the cross for all your sins?
* Do you believe that He physically rose from the dead?
* If Jesus were standing here right now and you asked Him to save you, would He do it?
* How long would you be saved for?
* Is there anything that you could ever do to mess that up?
* You could do alot of things that will mess up your life on earth, but could you ever mess that up?

#### Wrap Up Prayer
If they understood that far.. 
Say _“Let me go ahead and pray with you before I go, and I want to help you tell God that that's what you believe. You can just repeat after me and I'm just going to help you tell this to God right now. Let’s bow our heads and pray”._
Don’t ask people first if they want to pray, because you want them to receive Christ if they believe and understand the Bible.
   If they didn't fully understand.. Take it as a seed planted.

Why people might not want to pray with you
* They were just going along with what you were saying but didn’t really listen
* They are super shy/embarrassed and don't want to do it (give them the prayer to do in their own time)
* They didn't understand/get it. Response: So let me ask you this, what do you personally believe a person has to do to get to Heaven? To see if they understood. It may not have been their day. 
* Don't waste your time and push it, and move on to someone who is ready to receive the truth. Matthew 11:15 - He that hath ears to hear, let him hear.

#### What is the prayer itself?
A guide.. Does Not need to be exactly like this. 

_“Dear Lord. I know I'm a sinner, I know I deserve to go to hell, but I believe that you died on the cross for my sins and rose again. Please save me right now and give me eternal life. I'm only trusting you alone Jesus, Amen.”_

If they have a speech impediment it could even be as simple as _“Dear Jesus, Please save me, Amen”._ 

#### Luke 15:10
```Likewise, I say unto you, there is joy in the presence of the angels of God over one sinner that repenteth.```

Break it down into smaller sections as they repeat. 
Remind them it's not the words that save them, but believing in their heart what they are saying is true. 

If they say, they have already prayed that prayer before, explain to them that it is not the prayer that saves you, it's that you have to believe on Christ and fully trust Him. e.g “Well when I first got here, you said you have to do \_\_\_\_ to go to Heaven, now you see it is by faith and believing on Jesus alone, so now you are ready to call upon the name of the Lord”
"You need to choose to believe and ask God to save you right now."

```Romans 10:13 - For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.```

```Romans 10:9-10 - That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved. For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation.```

If they still object, just walk away. 

**Note**: Confessing isn't a “work”. Asking for something isn't working for it. 

```John 4:10 - Jesus answered and said unto her, If thou knewest the gift of God, and who it is that saith to thee, Give me to drink; thou wouldest have asked of him, and he would have given thee living water.```

After you've prayed - **what's next?**

```Ephesians 4:30 - And grieve not the holy Spirit of God, whereby ye are sealed unto the day of redemption.```

#### Don't ask: 
* How do you feel? > It's not about feelings
* Did you mean that? > Placing doubt in their mind

#### Give them assurance:
Say _“Hey you meant that, didn't you. You know the Bible says you're on your way to Heaven. There's nothing you can do to lose it. Isn't that great news?”_

#### Leave them with something to help them grow as a new Christian:
* [New Believer PDF](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/974486895180533780/998486903617753098/New_Believer.pdf) by [Clarissa](https://www.reddit.com/user/ClarissaRomans4/)
* Invite them to [Saved Baptists](https://discord.gg/7R4Aqyxmz2)
* New Testament/Full Bible (KJV)
* DVD/Preaching CD
* Open the Bible and show them where to start, bookmark John. 
* Ask them to decide to make the commitment to read the whole book of John before they quit. 
* Assure them that they will get used to the language and they will like it
* Go to the table of contents and check it off to keep track
* Invite them to church, ask them to find you when they get there
* Encourage them to get baptised 

```Acts 8:36-37 - And as they went on their way, they came unto a certain water: and the eunuch said, See, here is water; what doth hinder me to be baptized? And Philip said, If thou believest with all thine heart, thou mayest. And he answered and said, I believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God.```

#### Main emphasis:
To help people, you love people, do the best job you can.
